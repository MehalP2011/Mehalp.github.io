<h2>How its done</h2>

<h3>Ugh, you came at a bad time<br>
But you just crossed the line<br>
You wanna get wild?<br>
Okay, I'll show you wild<br>
 Better come right, better luck tryin', gettin' to our level<br>
'Cause you might die, never the time, tryna start a battle<br>
Bleedin' isn't in my blood, 뼈속부터 달라서<br>
Beatin' you is what I do, do, do, yeah<br><br>
  Body on body, I'm naughty, not even sorry<br>
And when you pull up, I'll pull up, a little late to the party<br>
Na-na-na-na, locked and loaded, I was born for this<br>
There ain't no point in avoidin' it<br>
Annoyed? A bit 불을 비춰 다 비켜, 네 앞길을 뺏겨<br><br>
  Knockin' you out like a lullaby<br>
Hear that sound ringin' in your mind<br>
Better sit down for the show<br>
'Cause I'm gonna show you how it's done, done, done<br><br>
  Huntrix don't miss<br>
How it's done, done, done<br>
(Hey) Huntrix don't quit<br>
How it's done, done, done <br><br>
  Run, run, we run the town<br>
Whole world playin' our sound<br>
Turnin' up, it's goin' down<br>
Huntrix show this, how it's done, done, done<br><br>
  Yeah, somethin' about when you come for the crown, that's so humblin', huh?<br>
갑자기 왜 그래? 먼저 건드려, 왜? 이제야 포기해, what?<br>
Nothin' to us, run up, you're done up, we come up from sunup to sundown, so come out to play<br>
Won either way, we're one in a million, we kill 'em, like "Really?" You want it? Okay<br><br>
Heels, nails, blade, mascara<br>
Fit check for my napalm era<br>
Need to beat my face, make it cute and savage<br>
Mirror, mirror on my phone, who's the baddest? (Us, hello?)<br><br>
  Knockin' you out like a lullaby<br>
Hear that sound ringin' in your mind<br>
Better sit down for the show<br>
'Cause I'm gonna show you (I'm gonna show you)<br>
(I'm gonna show you) how it's done, done, done<br><br>
  I don't talk, but I bite, full of venom (uh)<br>
Spittin' facts, you know that's how it's done, done, done<br>
Okay, like, I know I ramble, but when shootin' my words, I go Rambo<br>
Took blood, sweat, and tears, to look natural (uh)<br>
That's how it's done, done, done<br><br>
  Hear our voice unwaverin'<br>
'Til our song defeats the night<br>
Makin' fear afraid to breathe<br>
'Til the dark meets the light (how it's done, done, done)<br><br>
Run, run, we run the town (done, done, done)<br>
Whole world playin' our sound (done, done, done)<br>
Turnin' up, it's goin' down (done, done, done)<br>
Huntrix, show this how it's done, done, done<br><br>
  We hunt you down, down, down (down, done, done, done)<br>
We got you now, now, now (got you now, done, done, done)<br>
We show you how, how, how (show you how)<br>
  Huntrix, don't miss, how it's done, done, done<br><br></h3>
  
  <h2>What it sounds like<h2>
    
    <h3>Nothing but the truth now<br>
Nothing but the proof of what I am<br>
The worst of what I came from, patterns I'm ashamed of<br>
Things that even I don't understand<br><br>
      I tried to fix it, I tried to fight it<br>
My head was twisted, my heart divided
My lies all collided<br>
I don't know why I didn't trust you to be on my side<br><br>
      I broke into a million pieces, and I can't go back<br>
But now I'm seeing all the beauty in the broken glass<br>
The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony<br>
My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like<br><br>
      Why did I cover up the colors stuck inside my head?<br>
I should've let the jagged edges meet the light instead<br>
Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony<br>
      The song we couldn't write, this is what it sounds like<br><br></h3>
      
<h2>Golden<h2>
  <h3>I was a ghost, I was alone (Hah)<br>
Eoduwojin (Hah) apgilsoge (Ah)<br>
Given the throne I didn't know (Hah) how to believe (Hah)<br>
I was the queen that I'm meant to be (Ah)<br>
I lived two lives, tried to play both sides<br>
But I couldn't find my own place<br>
Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild<br>
But now that's how I'm getting paid, kkeuteosbsi on stage<br><br>
  I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin'<br>
Like I'm born to be<br>
We dreamin' hard, we came so far<br>
Now I believe<br><br>
  We're goin' up, up, up<br>
It's our moment<br>
You know together we're glowing<br>
Gonna be, gonna be golden<br>
Oh, up, up, up<br>
With our voices<br>
Yeongwonhi kkaejil su eobsneun<br>
Gonna be, gonna be golden<br><br>
Oh, I'm done hidin' now I'm shinin'<br>
Like I'm born to be<br>
Oh, our time, no fear, no lies<br>
That's who we're born to be<br><br>
  Waited so long to break these walls down<br>
To wake up and feel like me<br>
Put these patterns all in the past now<br>
And finally live like the girl they all see<br><br>
  No more hiding, I'll be shining<br>
Like I'm born to be<br>
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong<br>
And I know I believe<br><br>
  We're goin' up, up, up<br>
It's our moment<br>
You know together we're glowing<br>
Gonna be, gonna be golden<br>
Oh, up, up, up<br>
With our voices<br>
Yeongwonhi kkaejil su eobsneun<br>
Gonna be, gonna be golden<br><br>
  Oh, I'm done hidin', now I'm shining<br>
Like I'm born to be<br>
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies<br>
That's who we're born to be<br><br>
  ou know we're gonna be, gonna be golden<br>
We're gonna be, gonna be<br>
Born to be, born to be glowin'<br>
Balgge bichnaneun urin<br>
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies<br>
    That's who we're born to be<br><br></h3>

  <h2>Free</h2>
  <h3>I tried to hide but something broke<br>
I tried to sing, couldn't hit the notes<br>
The words kept catching in my throat<br>
I tried to smile, I was suffocating though<br>
But here with you, I can finally breathe<br>
You say you're no good, but you're good for me<br>
I've been hoping to change, now I know we can change<br>
But I won't if you're not by my side<br><br>
Why does it feel right every time I let you in?<br>
We could be free, free
We can't fix it if we never face it
Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless<br><br>
Why does it feel like I can tell you anything?<br>
All the secrets that keep me in chains, and<br>
All the damage that might make me dangerous<br>
You got a dark side, guess you're not the only one<br>
What if we both tried fighting what we're running from?<br>
We can't fix it if we never face it<br>
What if we find a way to escape it?<br><br>
We could be free, free<br>
We could be free, free<br>
We can't fix it if we never face it<br>
Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless<br><br>
Ooh, time goes by, and I lose perspective<br>
Yeah, hope only hurts, so I just forget it<br>
But you're breaking through all the dark in me when I thought that nobody could<br>
And you're waking up all these parts of me that I thought were buried for good<br><br>
Between imposter and this monster, I been lost inside my head<br>
Ain't no choice when all these voices keep me pointing towards no end<br>
It's just easy when I'm with you, no one sees me the way you do<br>
I don't trust it, but I want to, I keep coming back to<br><br>
Why does it feel right every time I let you in?<br>
Why does it feel like I can tell you anything?<br>
We can't fix it if we never face it<br>
What if we find a way to escape it?<br><br>
We could be free, free<br>
We can't fix it if we never face it<br>
Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless<br><br>
Oh, so take my hand, it's open (Free, free)<br>
What if we heal what's broken? (Free, free)<br><br>
I tried to hide but something broke<br>
I couldn't sing, but you give me hope<br>
We can't fix it if we never face it<br>
    Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless<br><br></h3>
